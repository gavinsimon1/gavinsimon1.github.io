   <h4 class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.875em";>Digital Marketing Specialist</h4>
    <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>One of my roles at the agency is as a digital marketing specialist.  In that role I research digital advertising trends and products, decide on the best platforms to place ads (based on client strategy and needs), and develop ads that appeal to customers. </p>
    <h4 class="blog" id="digital-advertising"  style="font-size: 1.875em";>Digital Advertising</h4>
    <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>Digital Advertising has been really enjoyable to learn.  I’ve had some great advertising teachers including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougharrishawaii/">Doug Harris</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickahler/">Patrick Ahler</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://stefankosel.com/">Stefan Kosel</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albet/">Albet Buddahim</a>.  Each of these marketing experts have helped me to put tools into my digital marketing tool kit.  They have shown me the importance of thoughtful campaign strategy and careful execution.  Google marketing experts were also great resources for improving our Google ad campaigns.</p>
   <h4 class="blog" style="font-size: 1.875em";>Google Ads</h4>
       <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>I started by focusing on Google PPC campaigns, then branched out to the rest of the <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/collections/products/">Google ad platforms</a> including YouTube ads, display ads, remarketing, map ads, gmail ads.  Google Shopping Ads have been great for some of our ecommerce clients.   Google provides great training at <a href="https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list">Skillshop</a>.  I’m currently <a href="/#certifications">certified in many Google products</a> including: Fundamentals of Digital Marketing Certification, Google My Business Certification, Google Shopping Ads Certification, Google Ads Video Certification, Google Dispaly Ads Certification, Google Analytics Certification and Advanced Google Analytics Certification.  
        YouTube is a great resource.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Surfsideppc">Surfside PPC</a>has a lot of great information.  
</p>
     <h4 class="blog" style="font-size: 1.875em";>Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads</h4>
       <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>Facebook and Instagram ads are the most fickle.  They are arguably the 2nd most important platform behind Google, and can drive significant returns.  The first challenge is getting admin access to clients accounts.  This can also be a time consuming process.  Facebook business manager should have admin access to the Facebook page, any existing ad accounts and Instagram.  Once all this is set-up, we can start running ad campaigns.  These ad campaigns need to be set-up and run with care.  Facebook provides great audience targeting features for connecting with potential customers.  There are many types of Facebook ads including Image ads, Video ads, Carousel ads, Instant Experience ads, and Collection ads.  As long as Instagram is connected to the Facebook account, the ads will also show on Instagram.  Carousel ads and video ads are my favorite.  Facebook’s platform is less user friendly than Google, with limited analytics.  A/B tests are easy with Facebook, and they are a great way to improve low-performing ads.   </p>
    <h4 class="blog" style="font-size: 1.875em";>Yelp Ads</h4>
   <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>The agency I work for became a certified Yelp partner early in my digital marketing journey, and they have been great to work with.  I needed to get certified in Yelp and we undergo compliance training and reviews on a regular basis.  We work directly with an awesome Yelp Partner Sales Director.  Most searches on Yelp are unbranded, which means customers are searching for things like Italian food, instead of the name of an Italian restaurant.  Advertising on Yelp is a great way to get in front of these potential customers.  The Yelp Enhanced Profile provides a call to action button, removes competitor ads, and allows you to control the images shown to customers.  It is a great addition to a Yelp page, and we’ve seen the results drive business for our clients. </p>
   
     <h4 class="blog" style="font-size: 1.875em";>LinkedIn Ads</h4>
   <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>Advertising on LinkedIn is a good lead generator for B2B marketing.  LinkedIn ads allow you to target specific roles and industries to show an ad to.  LinkedIn ads are usually expensive, so they are not my first choice.  But if a client is focused on B2B, this is a great platform to use.  There are many formats to choose from including Sponsored Content, Sponsored Messaging, Lead Gen Forms, Text and Dynamic Ads.  These tools help clients build awareness of their brand, and drive lead generation for their business.  A well thought out landing page and CRM platform is critical for these ads.  </p>
   
   
     <h4 class="blog" style="font-size: 1.875em";>TripAdvisor Ads</h4>
   <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>TripAdvisor is a fairly simple ad platform.  You basically load an ad into the system and let it run.  The platform is a great layer of support for restaurants, but gets a lower return on investment than some of the other platforms.  I put it in the nice to have category.  TripAdvisor did acquire SinglePlatform, now called Menu Connect, which allows restaurants to manage menus on Tripadvisor, Google, Yelp, Facebook and more. </p>
   
     <h4 class="blog" style="font-size: 1.875em";>Analytics tracking and Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s)</h4>
   <p class="blog"  style="font-size: 1.5em";>Tracking ad campaigns is the most difficult, and interesting part of the process for me.  Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel are the most important to set-up.  I use Google Tag Manager to manage all of the tracking code.  Google is transitioning from Universal Analytics to GA4 next year.  I hope they make GA4 better because it’s lacking a lot of the features of UA.  There are many 3rd party analytics tools that provide added vision to the success of a campaign.  The most important metric though is usually sales.  That is where tracking KPIs monthly is incredibly helpful.  It allows both the marketer and client to get a 10,000 foot view of the business, then to zoom into specific elements to identify areas of improvement.  Tracking and summarizing sales, online marketing campaigns, social media, email marketing, SEO campaigns, and proximity marketing metrics become easier when you see it month over month, year over year. </p>
